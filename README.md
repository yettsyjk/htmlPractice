# Basic HTML

Write the HTML necessary to match the mockup images. It does not need to be pixel perfect (just eyeball it) but it should be close, with font, layout, and spacing properly accounted for.  Feel free to use CSS to match the mockup as close as you can.

Boilerplate code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title></title>
   </head>
   <body>

   </body>
</html>
```

Please name each html file with the same name as the mockup you are replicating. For example: mockup1.jpg => mockup1.html

- STRETCH GOAL 1: Add some styling using inline styles (in the style attribute of the element)
- STRETCH GOAL 2: Add some styling using a separate CSS file
- STRETCH GOAL 3: Use [Bootstrap CSS](https://getbootstrap.com/) to style them
